He grew up in the Kootenays of British Columbia where the mountains are what turned his head towards the sky. He has his Private Pilot's license as well as Glider instructors rating. When he’s not doing DPM or trying to figure out C++, you can find him scouting out the latest allyoucanfinish sushi restaurant. If his moves at New City Gas don’t impress you, then make sure to join him when he’s back at it again with the white (rental) vans for our PFD events. Interesting Fact: Every summer Alex has taught 1517 year olds how to fly, they all have their license!</p><ul class="icons"><li><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/AFarns" target="_blank" class="icon fa-linkedin"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></li></ul></div> </section> <section class="post"> <span class="image" style="width:"><img src="images/lauren1.png" alt="" /></span><div class="content"><h3>Lauren Nagel - <i><span style="font-weight: normal;">External</span></i></h3><p>Lauren is in her third year at McGill studying Molecular Biology and International Development Studies.
